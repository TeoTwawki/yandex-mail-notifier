Yandex.Mail notifier for Chrome
===============================

**The project is currently under active development.**

# Important
One day this repo will be merged to https://github.com/ivantsov/yandex-mail-notifier, because Firefox is going to support WebExtensions API - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions. So that we can reuse common parts of the extension and merged these two repos.

# Roadmap
- add options page
- add notifications (should be based on options from the step above)
- add tests (Jest)
- add flow (the project is not so big but it's just a good opportunity to try it)
- add auto publishing to Chrome Store
